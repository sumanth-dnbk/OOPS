# OOPS physics engine

# v1

Supports gravity and collision detection

# v2

->detects collisons with mouse and calls out that collision is done
->Does elastic collisions place 5 squares in air and give them x velocity and see the periodic motion happen!

# v3

->object can be attached to spring(s)
->we can give the object the spring coordinates and the spring fixes to one end at the object and other end at the specified co ordinates
